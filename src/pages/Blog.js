            <p>Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known
                as the "saffron crocus". The vivid crimson stigma and styles, called threads, are collected and
                dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. Although some doubts remain on
                its origin, it is believed that saffron originated in Iran. However, Greece and
                Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant. Saffron
                crocus slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North
                Africa, North America, and Oceania.</p>
